# Pokemon Bugmerald Version

## What is?

Bugmerald Version is a decomp hack project based off RHH's [pokeemerald](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion) decompilation project.
Current pokeemerald-expansion version 1.71: 

Have you always been annoyed that your precious first route bug types get outclassed before you're even halfway through the game? That bug types routinely get the short end of the stick in stats and abilities? Does it bother you that Bug type is considered the worst competitive type in the entire game? Do you want to be the Bug Catcher that takes on the Elite Four instead of wandering aimlessly in Viridian Forest? Good news! This is the hack for you.

Bugmerald Version tasks you with becoming the new Champion in a Hoenn region where only Bug Types are available in the wild. Not to worry, improvements have been made across the board to your favorite Bug Types and the matchup chart and every Bug Type through Gen 9 is available to catch! But at the same time, be careful! The Gym Leaders and E4 have caught wind of the rising Bug Type and they have powerful new teams prepared to take them down. And there may be an even bigger threat brewing behind the mischief of Team Aqua and Magma...
